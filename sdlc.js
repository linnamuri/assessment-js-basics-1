/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The analysis stage includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes.This includes all the specifications for software, hardware, and network requirements for the system they plan to build. This will prevent them from overdrawing funding or resources when working at the same place as other development teams."

const design = ""

const Implementation = ""

const TestingAndIntegration = "During the testing stage, developers will go over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested."

const maintain = "The SDLC doesnâ€™t end when software reaches the market. Developers must now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users."
